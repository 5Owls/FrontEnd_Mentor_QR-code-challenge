# FrontEnd_Mentor_QR-code-challenge
My first Frontend Mentor challenge

challenges for me: the position and space of elements on the page. 

I had my screen in half(half webpage, other half atom to code). I thought I was finished but then I resized(made it larger to fit my screen) my webpage and the qr code grew way out of proportain. Something I need to work on.

It did take me a long time(more than three hours) to complete this challenge but this is with various interruptions.
